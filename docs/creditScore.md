1. Raw data

**Interest rate on credit card**: The cost of borrowing money if you don't pay off your balance in full. Normally, if you pay your full statement balance by the due date, you usually don't pay interest. If you carry a balance (the remaining balance not paid off), interest starts accruing. Interest rates on credit cards are NOT the same for everyone. A number of variables can influence the interest rate, such as: risk, behavior (if you always pay in full, might have lower interest rates), market and economic conditions. It may also "change due to fluctuations in the supply and demand of credit. When demand for credit is high or when supply of credit is low, interest rates tend to rise. When demand for credit is low or supply of credit is high, interest rates tend to fall." [Forces behind interest rates](https://www.investopedia.com/insights/forces-behind-interest-rates/)
