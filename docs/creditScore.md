1. Raw data

**Interest rate on credit card**: The cost of borrowing money if you don't pay off your balance in full. Normally, if you pay your full statement balance by the due date, you usually don't pay interest. If you carry a balance (the remaining balance not paid off), interest starts accruing. Interest rates on credit cards are NOT the same for everyone. A number of variables can influence the interest rate, such as: risk, behavior (if you always pay in full, might have lower interest rates), market and economic conditions. It may also "change due to fluctuations in the supply and demand of credit. When demand for credit is high or when supply of credit is low, interest rates tend to rise. When demand for credit is low or supply of credit is high, interest rates tend to fall." [Forces behind interest rates](https://www.investopedia.com/insights/forces-behind-interest-rates/)

**Number of loans**: There is no fixed global or universally mandated number of loans a client can have. Technically, while you can apply for multiple loans, approval relies on meeting the specific lender's financial criteria.

**Types of loans**:

What happens when applying to a loan?
Lenders conduct a credit check whenever you actively apply for a loan, credit card, credit line increase or financing at a car dealership. May vary, but usually applying for a personal loan may take less than five points off your FICO score. There are two types of credit inquiries: a hard credit inquiry (hard pull) and a soft credit inquiry (soft pull).

Hard inquiry: Lender contacts credit reporting agencies for a credit report. These inquiries stay on your credit report for two years.

Soft inquiry: Is more of a routine, can occur without your consent and aren't typically aligned with a loan application. It doesn't affect your credit score.

"Having a personal loan might even boost your score, even though the initial application will cause a dip. For example:
- If you’re responsible and make timely installment payments to the lender, the loan may help you to build credit.
- Adding a personal loan may increase your credit mix, which makes up 10% of your FICO score.2 Having a variety of loans and credit cards may help your score."

- Credit-builder loan: 
You make fixed payments to a lender and then get access to the loan amount at the end of the loan term. That's different from typical loans, which involve borrowing money upfront and then repaying it over time. This type of loan gives you a opportunity to show that you can make consistent, on-time payments. Beneficial for people with little to no credit history or for those looking to improve their credit score. May be easier to get approved than a personal loan, but might algo come with higher interest rates or fees.

- Auto loan:
You borrow money from a lender to purchase a car. You'll repay yhe loan in fixed installments over a set period, and interest will be charged on the money you borrow. Lenders tend to view lower credit score borrowers as riskier, resulting in higher rates. If you have a low credit score, consider looking for a bad credit auto loan, which has more lenient acceptance criteria. You can also wait to buy a car until you improve your credit score. Is you do not repay the loan, you risk losing the vehicle, as it serves as collateral [What is an auto loan and how does it work?](https://www.bankrate.com/loans/auto-loans/what-is-an-auto-loan/#what-is)

- Debt consolidation loan:
A single loan that you take out to pay off mutiple existing debts, such as credit card balances or personal loans, into one monthly payment. The goal is to sumplify your finances by having one regular payment. How it works:
    - Combine your debts: You apply for a new loan and, if approved, use the funds to pay off your existing debts.
    - Make one payment: Instead of making multiple payments to different lenders, you now make one single, regular payment to the new lender.
    - Lower interest (potential): If the new loan has a lower interest rate than your combined old debts, you can save money on interest over time

- Home Equity Loan:
A home equity loan—also known as an equity loan, home equity installment loan, or second mortgage—is a type of consumer debt. Home equity loans allow homeowners to borrow against the equity in their homes. The loan amount is based on the difference between the home’s current market value and the homeowner’s mortgage balance due. Home equity loans tend to be fixed-rate, while the typical alternative, home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), generally have variable rates.

- Mortgage Loan:
Is a loan used to purchase or maintain a home, plot of land, or other real estate. The borrower agrees to pay the lender over time, typically in a series of regular payments divided into principal and interest. The property then serves as collateral to secure the loan.
A borrower must apply for a mortgage through their preferred lender and meet several requirements, including minimum credit scores and down payments. Mortgage applications undergo a rigorous underwriting process before they reach the closing phase. Mortgage types, such as conventional or fixed-rate loans, vary based on the borrower's needs.

- Personal Loan:
A personal loan is a type of installment credit issued to a borrower by a lender, such as a bank, credit union, or online lender. You must meet the lender's eligibility requirements to get a personal loan. If approved, you can use your loan for almost anything, such as paying for home renovations or a large purchase. You're responsible for repaying the loan by making regular payments over a certain period, which usually includes interest.

- Student Loan:
An education loan is a sum of money borrowed to finance a post-secondary education or higher education-related expenses. Education loans are intended to cover the cost of tuition, books and supplies, and living expenses while the borrower is in the process of pursuing a degree.
Payments are often deferred while students are in college and, depending on the lender, for an additional six-month period after earning a degree. This deferment period is also referred to as a "grace period." [What Is an Education Loan?](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/education-loan.asp)
